# Secret Santa Assignment System

## Overview
This project automates the Secret Santa assignment process. Employees are assigned a Secret Santa while ensuring that:
- An employee cannot be assigned themselves.
- Assignments do not repeat from the previous year.
- Each employee has exactly one Secret Santa and one Secret Child.

The system processes employee data from CSV files and returns a new CSV with assignments.
