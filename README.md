# Secret Santa App  

## Overview  
This is a full-stack Secret Santa application that allows users to upload employee lists, process Secret Santa assignments, and download the assignments as a CSV file. It consists of a **React frontend** and a **Node.js backend**.

## Client Setup (React)  

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)  
- npm or yarn  

### Installation  
```sh
cd client
npm install  # or yarn install
```  

### Running the Client  
```sh
npm run dev  # or yarn dev
```  
The frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Server Setup (Node.js + Express)  

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)  
- MongoDB (if applicable)  

### Installation  
```sh
cd server
npm install  # or yarn install
```  

### Environment Variables  
Create a `.env` file inside the `server` directory with the following:  
```
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```
Modify it based on your needs.  

### Running the Server  
```sh
npm run dev  # or yarn dev
```  
The backend runs on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## API Endpoints  

### POST `/api/v1/generate-secret-child`  
- **Description:** Uploads employee lists and assigns Secret Santa pairs.  
- **Request:** `multipart/form-data` with `employeeList` and optional `previousYearList`.  
- **Response:** CSV file with assignments.  

---
## CSV File Formats
### Employee List CSV Format
This file should contain a list of employees participating in Secret Santa.
```
Employee_Name,Employee_EmailID
Alice,alice@example.com
Bob,bob@example.com
Charlie,charlie@example.com
...
```

### Previous Assignments CSV Format
This file should contain past Secret Santa assignments (optional but recommended to prevent repeat assignments).
```
Employee_Name,Employee_EmailID,Secret_Child_Name,Secret_Child_EmailID
Alice,alice@example.com,Bob,bob@example.com
Bob,bob@example.com,Charlie,charlie@example.com
Charlie,charlie@example.com,Alice,alice@example.com
...
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Workflow & Business Logic  

### **How the App Works**  
1. **User Uploads Employee List**  
   - The user selects a **CSV file** containing employee details (Name, Email).  
   - Optionally, the user can upload the **previous year's assignments** to prevent duplicate pairings.  

2. **Processing the Assignments**  
   - The backend reads the employee list and shuffles it.  
   - It assigns a **Secret Santa** to each employee while ensuring:  
     - An employee is not assigned to themselves.  
     - If a previous yearâ€™s list exists, the same pair is **not repeated**.  
     - The algorithm tries to ensure a fair random distribution.  

3. **Displaying & Downloading Results**  
   - The assignments are displayed in a table format on the frontend.  
   - Users can **download the assignments** as a CSV file.  

### **Conditions & Constraints**  
âœ” Employees cannot be assigned themselves as their Secret Santa.  
âœ” If a previous yearâ€™s list is provided, the same pairs cannot be repeated.  
âœ” The algorithm ensures a random and fair distribution.  
âœ” The application supports **CSV uploads only** (no manual input).
